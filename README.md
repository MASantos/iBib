# iBib 

Eventually[^$\dagger$], this could a web-based, book (pdf) browser Ã  la OSX-coverflow or Calibre.

It comes from the limitations I faced with Calibre: the latter requires the user running Calibre
to own the files (books) it shows. I was looking for a "Library" app, where users would be able
to read, but not copy the files -so as to make sure no one can accuse me of distributing material
which I may not be allowed to distribute -say I own an eBook and let another user of my machine
to read it; but I don't want him to get a copy of it from me.

# TODO

The main thing would be to see if there would be an easy-enough way for letting the browser to display say a PDF and
yet deter the average/not-enough-motivated user from downloading it[^$\dagger\dagger$]. The default PDF
viewer of course allows straightfoward saving of said pdf file.

After this, basically just eyecandy.

[^$\dagger$]: This has a low, low,...low priority right now... :-)
[^$\dagger\dagger$]: Of course, if the browser "shows" something, the user already downloaded it!

Initially this project had the appropiately boring name of myLibrary... :-p. Some files may still show it.
